          <h2>Why London?</h2>
          <h3>London, the city of royalty and history</h3>
          <p>
            London is the capital and largest city of both England and the
            United Kingdom, with a population of 9.1 million people in 2024.
            London stands on the River Thames in southeast England, at the head
            of a 50-mile (80 km) tidal estuary down to the North Sea, and has
            been a major settlement for nearly 2,000 years. Its ancient core and
            financial centre, the City of London, was founded by the Romans as
            Londinium and has retained its medieval boundaries. The City of
            Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has been the
            centuries-long host of the national government and parliament.
          </p>
          <p>
            Four World Heritage Sites are located in London: Kew Gardens; the
            Tower of London; the site featuring the Palace of Westminster, the
            Church of St Margaret, and Westminster Abbey; and the historic
            settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory defines the
            prime meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. Other
            landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly
            Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge and Trafalgar Square.
            Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final,
            the Wimbledon Tennis Championships and the London Marathon. It
            became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games upon
            hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics.

              <h4>Big Ben</h4>
              <p>
                Commonly mistaken for the clock tower, Big Ben is actually the
                bell inside the clock.

                While the Great Clock of Westminster is a site to see, Big Ben
                is the name most people know it by. A great view of the clock is
                at the top of the London Eye.

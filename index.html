          <h2>Why London?</h2>
          <h3>London, the city of royalty and history</h3>
          <p>
            London is the capital and largest city of both England and the
            United Kingdom, with a population of 9.1 million people in 2024. Its
            wider metropolitan area is the largest in Western Europe, with a
            population of 15.1 million. London stands on the River Thames in
            southeast England, at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) tidal estuary
            down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for nearly
            2,000 years. Its ancient core and financial centre, the City of
            London, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and has retained its
            medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the west of the
            City of London, has been the centuries-long host of the national
            government and parliament. London grew rapidly in the 19th century,
            becoming the world's largest city at the time. Since the 19th
            century the name "London" has referred to the metropolis around the
            City of London, historically split between the counties of
            Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire, which since 1965
            has largely comprised the administrative area of Greater London,
            governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.

            Four World Heritage Sites are located in London: Kew Gardens; the
            Tower of London; the site featuring the Palace of Westminster, the
            Church of St Margaret, and Westminster Abbey; and the historic
            settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory defines the
            prime meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. Other
            landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly
            Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge and Trafalgar Square. The
            city has the most museums, art galleries, libraries and cultural
            venues in the UK, including the British Museum, the National
            Gallery, the Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, the British
            Library and numerous West End theatres. Important sporting events
            held in London include the FA Cup Final, the Wimbledon Tennis
            Championships and the London Marathon. It became the first city to
            host three Summer Olympic Games upon hosting the 2012 Summer
            Olympics.
